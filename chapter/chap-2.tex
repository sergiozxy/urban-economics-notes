\section{A TWo-Region Model}

All individuals in this economy, then, are assumed to share a utility function of the form:

\begin{equation}
    U = C_M^{\mu} C_A^{1 - \mu}
\end{equation}

where $C_A$ is consumption of the agricultural good and $C_M$ is consumption of a manufactures aggregate. The manufactures aggregate $C_M$ is defined by:

\begin{equation}
    C_M = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^N c_i^{(\sigma - 1)/\sigma}\right]^{\sigma/(\sigma - 1)}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the large number of potential products and $\sigma > 1$ is the elasticity of substitution among the products. The elasticity $\sigma$ is the second parameter determining the character of equilibrium in the model.
