\section{The model}

There are $N$ cities in the economy, where $N$ is endogenous, and a continuum $L$ of infinitely lived workers, each of which has one of $m$ possible discrete aptitudes. There are equal proportion of workers with each aptitude in the economy, but their distribution across cities is endogenously determined through migration. Let us index cities by $i$ and worker aptitudes by subcript $j$ so that $l_i^j$ denotes the supply of labor with aptitude $j$ in city $i$. Time is discrete and indexed by $t$.
