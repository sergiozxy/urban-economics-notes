\chapter{The timing and location of entry in growing markets}

\section{Model}

There are two firms $i \in \{1, 2\}$. Firm $i$ decides a time $t_i \geq 0$ and a location $x_i \in [0, 1]$ to enter the market. Firms incur a fixed cost of entry $F > 0$. Time is continuous and the horizon is infinite. Firms discount future cash flows at an interest rate of $r > 0$.
